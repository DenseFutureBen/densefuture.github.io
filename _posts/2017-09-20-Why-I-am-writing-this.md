More than two years ago, I basically stopped writing. I'd been advocating for better mass transit for years, and after a few wins, I didn't feel like there was much more for me to do - transit in Seattle would keep getting built for decades to come, and the marginal improvements I could make with further advocacy seemed minimal.

I'd started to focus on the other side of the equation - land use. You can build a wonderful subway station, but the only way many people will use it is if they can live near it. Sure, you can build a park and ride, or feed it with a local bus, but these are expensive, inefficient ways to get riders to transit.

Stepping back, I asked myself why I wanted all this transit? The underlying reason is simple: I want our species to survive, to stabilize our life on this planet. The most pressing existential threats we have all come down to using more resources than we have; carbon, food, water. Locally, our biggest contribution to that problem is how much carbon we emit to get ourselves around.

One way to reduce that carbon is to get a lot of people into a metal box together, instead of each traveling in their own.

No matter how many people are in it, the metal box, the transit, is still not that efficient. It's still a huge piece of infrastructure that takes a lot of energy, and it's still solving the problem of getting people across long distances. There's an even more efficient way to deal with this: density.

Many people are willing to live very close to all their needs, and walk to most of their destinations with just a bit of sidewalk provided for them. If the distances they traverse are short, that means all the wires and pipes and roads connecting those destinations can be very short as well. In short (hah), simply letting things be close together is the most efficient way we have of reducing our use of resources.

Going back to a couple of years ago, I saw that we have laws in place stopping us from putting things very close together. Even at our densest and most efficient, we're still wasting tons of energy and keeping our homes and workplaces far apart. I couldn't understand why people opposed density, and the arguments I heard against it were so specious and classist that I was turned off from organizing entirely.

Since then, I've looked for a way to move forward. I've tested arguments against detractors and lukewarm supporters alike. I've investigated where land use law originated, how it's used, and who benefits from it. I'm by no means an expert, but I see enough patterns that I think the best way to talk about density is to talk about zoning - how it's stopping us from becoming efficient, all the problems it's causing, and ultimately, why it should no longer exist.

I'll be writing here about what I continue to learn, in hopes that I can collect enough people smarter than I am to help me make this idea stick.
